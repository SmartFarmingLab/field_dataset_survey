	abstract = {Robotic weed control has seen increased research of late with its potential for boosting productivity in agriculture. Majority of works focus on developing robotics for croplands, ignoring the weed management problems facing rangeland stock farmers. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to widespread uptake of robotic weed control is the robust classification of weed species in their natural environment. The unparalleled successes of deep learning make it an ideal candidate for recognising various weed species in the complex rangeland environment. This work contributes the first large, public, multiclass image dataset of weed species from the Australian rangelands; allowing for the development of robust classification methods to make robotic weed control viable. The DeepWeeds dataset consists of 17,509 labelled images of eight nationally significant weed species native to eight locations across northern Australia. This paper presents a baseline for classification performance on the dataset using the benchmark deep learning models, Inception-v3 and ResNet-50. These models achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.1\% and 95.7\%, respectively. We also demonstrate real time performance of the ResNet-50 architecture, with an average inference time of 53.4 ms per image. These strong results bode well for future field implementation of robotic weed control methods in the Australian rangelands.},

	abstract = {The world’s most significant yield by production quantity is sugarcane. It is the primary source for sugar, ethanol, chipboards, paper, barrages, and confectionery. Many people are affiliated with sugarcane production and their products around the globe. The sugarcane industries make an agreement with farmers before the tillering phase of plants. Industries are keen on knowing the sugarcane field’s pre-harvest estimation for planning their production and purchases. The proposed research contribution is twofold: by publishing our newly developed dataset, we also present a methodology to estimate the number of sugarcane plants in the tillering phase. The dataset has been obtained from sugarcane fields in the fall season. In this work, a modified architecture of Faster R-CNN with feature extraction using VGG-16 with Inception-v3 modules and sigmoid threshold function has been proposed for the detection and classification of sugarcane plants. Significantly promising results with 82.10\% accuracy have been obtained with the proposed architecture, showing the viability of the developed methodology.},

	abstract = {Alternative non-chemical or chemical-reduced weed control tactics are critical for future integrated weed management, especially for herbicide-resistant weeds. Through weed detection and localization, machine vision technology has the potential to enable site- and species-specific treatments targeting individual weed plants. However, due to unstructured field circumstances and the large biological variability of weeds, robust and accurate weed detection remains a challenging endeavor. Deep learning (DL) algorithms, powered by large-scale image data, promise to achieve the weed detection performance required for precision weeding. In this study, a three-class weed dataset with bounding box annotations was curated, consisting of 848 color images collected in cotton fields under variable field conditions. A set of 13 weed detection models were built using DL-based one-stage and two-stage object detectors, including YOLOv5, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN, by transferring pretrained the object detection models to the weed dataset. RetinaNet (R101-FPN), despite its longer inference time, achieved the highest overall detection accuracy with a mean average precision (mAP@0.50) of 79.98\%. YOLOv5n showed the potential for real-time deployment in resource-constraint devices because of the smallest number of model parameters (1.8 million) and the fastest inference (17 ms on the Google Colab) while achieving comparable detection accuracy (76.58\% mAP@0.50). Data augmentation through geometric and color transformations could improve the accuracy of the weed detection models by a maximum of 4.2\%.

Therefore, site-specific weed control strategies based on automation are needed to reduce the additional time and effort required for weeding. Machine vision-based methods appear to be a promising approach for weed detection, but require high quality data on the species in a specific agricultural area. Here we present a dataset, the Moving Fields Weed Dataset (MFWD), which captures the growth of 28 weed species commonly found in sorghum and maize fields in Germany. A total of 94,321 images were acquired in a fully automated, high-throughput phenotyping facility to track over 5,000 individual plants at high spatial and temporal resolution. A rich set of manually curated ground truth information is also provided, which can be used not only for plant species classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, but also for multiple object tracking.},

Vision systems can support making better and more sustainable field management decisions, but also support the breeding of new crop varieties by allowing temporally dense and reproducible measurements. Recently, agricultural robotics got an increasing interest in the vision and robotics communities since it is a promising avenue for coping with the aforementioned lack of workers and enabling more sustainable production. While large datasets and benchmarks in other domains are readily available and enable significant progress, agricultural datasets and benchmarks are comparably rare. We present an annotated dataset and benchmarks for the semantic interpretation of real agricultural fields. Our dataset recorded with a UAV provides high-quality, pixel-wise annotations of crops and weeds, but also crop leaf instances at the same time. Furthermore, we provide benchmarks for various tasks on a hidden test set comprised of different fields: known fields covered by the training data and a completely unseen field.

Images of weeds growing within a variety of crops were gathered across variable environmental conditions with regards to soil types, resolution and light settings. Then, 9649 of these images were used for training the computer, which automatically divided the weeds into nine growth classes. The performance of this proposed convolutional neural network approach was evaluated on a further set of 2516 images, which also varied in term of crop, soil type, image resolution and light conditions. The overall performance of this approach achieved a maximum accuracy of 78\% for identifying Polygonum spp. and a minimum accuracy of 46\% for blackgrass. In addition, it achieved an average 70\% accuracy rate in estimating the number of leaves and 96\% accuracy when accepting a deviation of two leaves. These results show that this new method of using deep convolutional neural networks has a relatively high ability to estimate early growth stages across a wide variety of weed species.},

	abstract = {Reducing the use of pesticides through selective spraying is an important component towards a more sustainable computer-assisted agriculture. Weed identification at early growth stage contributes to reduced herbicide rates. However, while computer vision alongside deep learning have overcome the performance of approaches that use hand-crafted features, there are still some open challenges in the development of a reliable automatic plant identification system. These type of systems have to take into account different sources of variability, such as growth stages and soil conditions, with the added constraint of the limited size of usual datasets. This study proposes a novel crop/weed identification system that relies on a combination of fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional networks (Xception, Inception-Resnet, VGNets, Mobilenet and Densenet) with the “traditional” machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) trained with the previously deep extracted features. The aim of this approach was to avoid overfitting and to obtain a robust and consistent performance. To evaluate this approach, an open access dataset of two crop [tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)] and two weed species [black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.)] was generated. The pictures were taken by different production sites across Greece under natural variable light conditions from RGB cameras. The results revealed that a combination of fine-tuned Densenet and Support Vector Machine achieved a micro F1 score of 99.29\% with a very low performance difference between train and test sets. Other evaluated approaches also obtained repeatedly more than 95\% F1 score. Additionally, our results analysis provides some heuristics for designing transfer-learning based systems to avoid overfitting without decreasing performance.},

The images are collected at the semifield area at Aarhus University, Research Centre Flakkebjerg, Denmark, using a customized data acquisition platform that provides well-illuminated images with a ground resolution of ∼6.6 px mm      − 1     . All images are annotated with plant species using the EPPO encoding system, bounding box annotations for detection and extraction of individual plants, applied growth conditions and time passed since seeding. Additionally, the individual plants have been tracked temporally and given unique IDs. The dataset is accompanied by two experiments for: (1) plant instance detection and (2) plant species classification.

This paper presents a pioneering work of accurate soybean pod counting utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured from actual soybean fields in Michigan, USA. Specifically, this paper presents SoybeanNet, a novel point-based counting network that harnesses powerful transformer backbones for simultaneous soybean pod counting and localization with high accuracy. In addition, a new dataset of UAV-acquired images for soybean pod counting was created and open-sourced, consisting of 113 drone images with more than 260k manually annotated soybean pods. The images are taken from an altitude of approximately 13 ft, with angles between 53 and 58 degrees, under natural lighting conditions. Through comprehensive evaluations, SoybeanNet demonstrates superior performance over five state-of-the-art approaches when tested on the collected images. Remarkably, SoybeanNet achieves a counting accuracy of 84.51\% when tested on the testing dataset, attesting to its efficacy in real-world scenarios.

	abstract = {Weeds are among the major threats to cotton production. Overreliance on herbicides for weed control has accelerated the evolution of herbicide-resistance in weeds and caused increasing concerns about environments, food safety and human health. Machine vision systems for automated/robotic weeding have received growing interest towards the realization of integrated, sustainable weed management. However, in the presence of unstructured field environments and significant biological variability of weeds, it remains a serious challenge to develop reliable weed identification and detection systems. A promising solution to address this challenge are the development of arge-scale, annotated image datasets of weeds specific to cropping systems and data-driven AI (artificial intelligence) models for weed detection. Among various deep learning architectures, a diversity of YOLO (You Only Look Once) detectors is well-suited for real-time application and has enjoyed great popularity for generic object detection. This study presents a new dataset (CottoWeedDet12) of weeds important to cotton production in the southern United States (U.S.); it consists of 5648 images of 12 weed classes with a total of 9370 bounding box annotations, collected under natural light conditions and at varied weed growth stages in cotton fields. A novel, comprehensive benchmark of 25 state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors of seven versions including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Scaled-YOLOv4, YOLOR and YOLOv5, YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, has been established for weed detection on the dataset. Evaluated through the Monte-Caro cross validation with 5 replications, the detection accuracy in terms of mAP@0.5 ranged from 88.14 \% by YOLOv3-tiny to 95.22 \% by YOLOv4, and the accuracy in terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95] ranged from 68.18 \% by YOLOv3-tiny to 89.72 \% by Scaled-YOLOv4. All the YOLO models especially YOLOv5n and YOLOv5s have shown great potential for real-time weed detection, and data augmentation could increase weed detection accuracy.

	abstract = {Plant/background segmentation is a key component of digital image analysis in agriculture. It can be used for yield prediction models, crop growth, disease diagnosis and automated navigation tasks. In particular, well-known segmentation methods are strongly influenced by changing light conditions during image acquisition as well as different color variations of plants and the background in the scene. In this work, an algorithm was developed and evaluated which can perform robust automated plant/background segmentation under varying capture conditions such as overexposure or underexposure along with diverse colors of the crop and background. The algorithm relies on an index-based method for approximate pre-segmentation and uses this first approximation to calculate the threshold value for a segmentation using a color space model. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated with 200 images from 4 different cameras and settings. Furthermore, the algorithm quality was compared with existing index-based segmentation methods such as the excess green index, the excess red index, excess green minus excess red index. All indices were combined with Otsu thresholding. The results showed that the novel approach has a more robust performance and is more reliable than the other index-based segmentation methods. The investigations showed excellent results of the algorithm using the CieLab color space with semantic plant segmentation accuracies of 97.4\%.},

	abstract = {Meeting the growing demand for soybeans will require increased production. One approach would be to reduce yield loss from plant diseases. In the U.S., soybean diseases account for approximately 8–25\% of average annual yield loss. Early and accurate detection of pathogens is key for effective disease management strategies and can help to minimize pesticide usage and thus boost overall productivity. Recent advancements in computer vision could move us towards that goal by making disease diagnostics expertise more readily accessible to every-one. To that end, we developed an automated classifier of digital images of soybean diseases, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). For model training and validation, we acquired more than 9,500 original soybean images, representing eight distinct disease and deficiency classes: (1) healthy/asymptomatic, (2) bacterial blight, (3) Cercospora leaf blight, (4) downy mildew, (5) frogeye leaf spot, (6) soybean rust, (7) target spot, and (8) potassium deficiency. To make training more efficient we experimented with a variety of approaches to transfer learning, data engineering, and data augmentation. Our best performing model was based on the DenseNet201 architecture. After training from scratch, it achieved an overall testing accuracy of 96.8\%. Experimenting with full or partial freezing of core DenseNet201 model weights did not improve performance. Neither did a deliberate effort to increase the diversity of subject backgrounds in the digital images. Models performed best when trained on datasets composed exclusively of images of soybean leaves still attached to the plant in the field; conversely, mixing in images of detached leaves on simple backgrounds reduced performance. On the other hand, data augmentation to increase representational parity across disease classes provided a substantial performance boost. Our development experience may provide useful insights for researchers considering how to best build and analyze datasets for similar applications.},

	abstract = {A new aerial tobacco weed dataset with various field conditions. We have acquired a new tobacco-weed dataset using a Mavic Mini drone. Eight fields of tobacco crops are captured in Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. At different growth stages, these eight fields are captured at a crop age of 15 to 40 days approximately. Images are captured at 1920 × 1080-pixel resolution; due to system memory limitations, we have cropped non-overlapping images of resolution 480 × 352 for processing. This image patch cropping is implemented using a code that reads images and creates non-overlapping tile images using two nested loops; the respective annotation images are also cropped simultaneously. Dataset is captured at an average altitude of 4 m with a ground sampling distance of 0.1 cm/ pixel. Images are labeled manually; background, crop, and weed have label values of 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

	abstract = {Aphid infestations are one of the primary causes of extensive damage to wheat and sorghum fields and are one of the most common vectors for plant viruses, resulting in significant agricultural yield losses. To address this problem, farmers often employ the inefficient use of harmful chemical pesticides that have negative health and environmental impacts. As a result, a large amount of pesticide is wasted on areas without significant pest infestation. This brings to attention the urgent need for an intelligent autonomous system that can locate and spray sufficiently large infestations selectively within the complex crop canopies. We have developed a large multi-scale dataset for aphid cluster detection and segmentation, collected from actual sorghum fields and meticulously annotated to include clusters of aphids. Our dataset comprises a total of 54,742 image patches, showcasing a variety of viewpoints, diverse lighting conditions, and multiple scales, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world applications. In this study, we trained and evaluated four real-time semantic segmentation models and three object detection models specifically for aphid cluster segmentation and detection. Considering the balance between accuracy and efficiency, Fast-SCNN delivered the most effective segmentation results, achieving 80.46\% mean precision, 81.21\% mean recall, and 91.66 frames per second (FPS). For object detection, RT-DETR exhibited the best overall performance with a 61.63\% mean average precision (mAP), 92.6\% mean recall, and 72.55 on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Our experiments further indicate that aphid cluster segmentation is more suitable for assessing aphid infestations than using detection models.},

From this first experience in 2020, a few avenues for improvements have been identified, especially from the perspective of data size, head diversity and label reliability. To address these issues, the 2020 dataset has been reexamined, relabeled, and augmented by adding 1,722 images from 5 additional countries, allowing for 81,553 additional wheat heads to be added. We now release a new version of the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset in 2021, which is bigger, more diverse, and less noisy than the 2020 version.

	abstract = {Massive and high-quality in situ data are essential for Earth-observation-based agricultural monitoring. However, field surveying requires considerable organizational effort and money. Using computer vision to recognize crop types on geo-tagged photos could be a game changer allowing for the provision of timely and accurate crop-specific information. This study presents the first use of the largest multi-year set of labelled close-up in situ photos systematically collected across the European Union from the Land Use Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS). Benefiting from this unique in situ dataset, this study aims to benchmark and test computer vision models to recognize major crops on close-up photos statistically distributed spatially and through time between 2006 and 2018 in a practical agricultural policy relevant context. The methodology makes use of crop calendars from various sources to ascertain the mature stage of the crop, of an extensive paradigm for the hyper-parameterization of MobileNet from random parameter initialization, and of various techniques from information theory in order to carry out more accurate post-processing filtering on results. The work has produced a dataset of 169,460 images of mature crops for the 12 classes, out of which 15,876 were manually selected as representing a clean sample without any foreign objects or unfavorable conditions. The best-performing model achieved a macro F1 (M-F1) of 0.75 on an imbalanced test dataset of 8642 photos. Using metrics from information theory, namely the equivalence reference probability, resulted in an increase of 6\%. The most unfavorable conditions for taking such images, across all crop classes, were found to be too early or late in the season. The proposed methodology shows the possibility of using minimal auxiliary data outside the images themselves in order to achieve an M-F1 of 0.82 for labelling between 12 major European crops.},

	abstract = {One of the critical biotic stress factors paddy farmers face is diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and other organisms. These diseases affect plants’ health severely and lead to significant crop loss. Most of these diseases can be identified by regularly observing the leaves and stems under expert supervision. In a country with vast agricultural regions and limited crop protection experts, manual identification of paddy diseases is challenging. Thus, to add a solution to this problem, it is necessary to automate the disease identification process and provide easily accessible decision support tools to enable effective crop protection measures. However, the lack of availability of public datasets with detailed disease information limits the practical implementation of accurate disease detection systems. This paper presents Paddy Doctor, a visual image dataset for identifying paddy diseases. Our dataset contains 16,225 annotated paddy leaf images across 13 classes (12 diseases and normal leaf). We benchmarked the Paddy Doctor dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and four transfer learning based models (VGG16, MobileNet, Xception, and ResNet34). The experimental results showed that ResNet34 achieved the highest F1-score of 97.50\%. We release our dataset and reproducible code in the open source for community use.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh's economy is primarily driven by the agriculture sector. Rice is one of the staple food of Bangladesh. The count of panicles per unit area serves as a widely used indicator for estimating rice yield, facilitating breeding efforts, and conducting phenotypic analysis. By calculating the number of panicles within a given area, researchers and farmers can assess crop density, plant health, and prospective production. The conventional method of estimating rice yields in Bangladesh is time-consuming, inaccurate, and inefficient. To address the challenge of detecting rice panicles, this article provides a comprehensive dataset of annotated rice panicle images from Bangladesh. Data collection was done by a drone equipped with a 4 K resolution camera, and it took place on April 25, 2023, in Bonkhoria Gazipur, Bangladesh. During the day, the drone captured the rice field from various heights and perspectives. After employing various image processing techniques for curation and annotation, the dataset was generated using images extracted from drone video clips, which were then annotated with information regarding rice panicles. The dataset is the largest publicly accessible collection of rice panicle images from Bangladesh, consisting of 2193 original images and 5701 augmented images.},

	abstract = {Weeding operations represent an effective approach to increase crop yields. Reliable and precise weed detection is a prerequisite for achieving high-precision weed monitoring and control in precision agriculture. To develop an effective approach for detecting weeds within the red, green, and blue (RGB) images, two state-of-the-art object detection models, EfficientDet (coefficient 3) and YOLOv5m, were trained on more than 26,000 in situ labeled images with monocot/dicot classes recorded from more than 200 different fields in Denmark. The dataset was collected using a high velocity camera (HVCAM) equipped with a xenon ring flash that overrules the sunlight and minimize shadows, which enables the camera to record images with a horizontal velocity of over 50 km h-1. Software-wise, a novel image processing algorithm was developed and utilized to generate synthetic images for testing the model performance on some difficult occluded images with weeds that were properly generated using the proposed algorithm. Both deep-learning networks were trained on in-situ images and then evaluated on both synthetic and new unseen in-situ images to assess their performances. The obtained average precision (AP) of both EfficientDet and YOLOv5 models on 6625 synthetic images were 64.27\% and 63.23\%, respectively, for the monocot class and 45.96\% and 37.11\% for the dicot class. These results confirmed that both deep-learning networks could detect weeds with high performance. However, it is essential to verify both the model’s robustness on in-situ images in which there is heavy occlusion with a complicated background. Therefore, 1149 in-field images were recorded in 5 different fields in Denmark and then utilized to evaluate both proposed model’s robustness. In the next step, by running both models on 1149 in-situ images, the AP of monocot/dicot for EfficientDet and YOLOv5 models obtained 27.43\%/42.91\% and 30.70\%/51.50\%, respectively. Furthermore, this paper provides information regarding challenges of monocot/dicot weed detection by releasing 1149 in situ test images with their corresponding labels (RoboWeedMap) publicly to facilitate the research in the weed detection domain within the precision agriculture field.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in a myriad of applications, ranging from image recognition to language processing. Training such networks on graphics processing units (GPUs) currently offers unmatched levels of performance; however, GPUs are subject to large-power requirements. With recent advancements in high-level synthesis (HLS) techniques, new methods for accelerating deep networks using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are emerging. FPGA-based DNNs present substantial advantages in energy efficiency over conventional CPU- and GPU-accelerated networks. Using the Intel FPGA software development kit (SDK) for OpenCL development environment, networks described using the high-level OpenCL framework can be accelerated targeting heterogeneous platforms including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. These networks, if properly customized on GPUs and FPGAs, can be ideal candidates for learning and inference in resource-constrained portable devices such as robots and the Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices, where power is limited and performance is critical. Here, we introduce GPU- and FPGA-accelerated deterministically binarized DNNs, tailored toward weed species classification for robotic weed control. Our developed networks are trained and benchmarked using a publicly available weed species dataset, named DeepWeeds, which include close to 18 000 weed images. We demonstrate that our FPGA-accelerated binarized networks significantly outperform their GPU-accelerated counterparts, achieving a{\textgreater}7-fold decrease in power consumption, while performing inference on weed images 2.86 times faster compared to our best performing baseline full-precision GPU implementation. These significant benefits are gained whilst losing only 1.17\% of validation accuracy. In this paper, this is a significant step toward enabling deep inference and learning on IoT edge devices, and smart portable machines such as agricultural robots, which is the target application.},

	abstract = {Precision weed management offers a promising solution for sustainable cropping systems through the use of chemical-reduced/non-chemical robotic weeding techniques, which apply suitable control tactics to individual weeds or small clusters. Therefore, accurate identification of weed species plays a crucial role in such systems to enable precise, individualized weed treatment. Despite recent progress, the development of a robust weed identification and localization system in the presence of unstructured field environments remains a serious challenge, requiring supervised modeling using large volumes of annotated data. This paper makes a first comprehensive evaluation of deep transfer learning (DTL) for identifying common weed species specific to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems in southern United States (U.S.). A new dataset for weed identification was created, consisting of 5187 color images of 15 weed classes collected under natural light conditions and at varied weed growth stages, in cotton fields (primarily in Mississippi and North Carolina) during the 2020 and 2021 growth seasons. We evaluated 35 state-of-the-art deep learning models through transfer learning with repeated holdout validations and established an extensive benchmark for the considered weed identification task. DTL achieved high classification accuracy of F1 scores exceeding 95\%, requiring reasonably short training time (less than 2.5 h) across models. ResNeXt101 achieved the best overall F1-score of 98.93 ± 0.34\%, whereas 10 out of the 35 models achieved F1 scores near or above 98.0\%. However, the performance on minority weed classes with few training samples was less satisfactory for models trained with a conventional, unweighted cross entropy loss function. To address this issue, a weighted cross entropy loss function was adopted, which achieved substantially improved accuracies for minority weed classes (e.g., the F1-scores for Xception and MnasNet on the Spurred Anoda weed increased from 48\% to 90\% and 50\% to 82\%, respectively). Furthermore, a deep learning-based cosine similarity metric was employed to analyze the similarity among weed classes, assisting in the interpretation of classifications. Both the codes (https://github.com/Derekabc/CottonWeeds) for model benchmarking and the weed dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/yuzhenlu/cottonweedid15) of this study are made publicly available, which expect to be a valuable resource for future research on weed identification and beyond.},
